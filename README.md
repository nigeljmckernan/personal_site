# Personal Website Repository

This is the repository for deploying my personal website via [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

The site is built using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package in R.

Much of the convenience of building the site comes from the massive utility of the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) IDE.
