<p>If this is your first time visiting my site, please take the time to read my <a href="https://nigelmckernan.ca/media/Thesis_Nigel_McKernan.pdf">Masters Research Paper</a> and its <a href="https://nigelmckernan.ca/media/ma_paper">Appendix</a>.</p>
<p>The latter is more of a demonstration of the bulk of the R code I used to conduct my analysis.</p>
<p>My project used a hedonic regression model to establish a connection between real estate prices in the Canadian census metropolitan area market, and air pollutant concentrations (particularly with PM<sub>2.5</sub>).</p>
<p>Due there already being extensive research and literature on hedonic regression models, I sought to take a more novel approach compared to previous endeavours.</p>
<p>First, my project takes a novel approach by using an instrumental-variable (IV) approach in a panel-data context. The instrumental variables used were Wind Speed and Wind Direction.</p>
<p>Second, utilizing temporal disaggregation to turn several variables from Statistics Canada that were only available at an annual frequency, down to a monthly frequency.</p>
<p>Most of the analysis used for this project was done in R, with the first half of the Appendix vignette focusing on the more “data science-y” aspects of the project; incorporating and using packages from the <a href="https://tidyverse.org">Tidyverse</a>.</p>
<p>This was a huge project for me as it taught me the bulk of the core R programming skills that I now have.</p>
<p>If you find either my Thesis or its Appendix insightful or worthy of sharing, please leave me a comment or share with your peers!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
